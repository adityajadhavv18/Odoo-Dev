- In this we add a field to be displayed in the form which we created in product.py 
- so we create a new folder "views" where we make a file product.py and write the path in the data section of the main manifest file 
  views/product.xml

- After this we select a through edit view form option in which we have to add the field in the odoo environment and open it 
- After opening it , it will display a external id which will first display the module name and id of the form
  eg: product.product_template_only_form_view
        ðŸ‘† this is module name and after the dot is the required id 
- we copy the id from external id and then in the main file of views which is auto generated by odoo then we search this id 
- After we search this id we copy the whole code which represents it that is the whole record tag and then we remove priority and primary 
  and the whole code inside xpath 
- After this we paste our id in the reference and so that it can be inherited and verify the model name so it can be inherited correctly
- then we add the xpath first parameter is type which is field and then name of the field [@name='default_code ] and postion="before"
- After that we add the name of out customized field <field name="processor"/> then we close the xpath tag 
- Restart the odoo service and upgrade the module then we can view the custom field in the form 
- we can view the customized field in the form and then we can see out inheritance in inherited views

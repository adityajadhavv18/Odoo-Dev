#Lets go step by step of how to inherit and launch custom module with model and field in odoo app environment 

- First make an odoo directory by using ./odoo-bin scaffold module_name directory_name
- after creation of that file make the init.py file and manifest.py file 
- In the manifest.py add the neccesary details and dependencies of the module and make installable true so that the module can be 
  can be installed in the odoo environment 
- Make another folder for the models of the module and we can name is as models itself 
- In models folder make the model file ,here we have made product.py which is also the dependency of the module
  all the models which we are going to inherit in a module will be the dependencies of it.

  from odoo import models,fields

  class ProductTemplate(models.Model):
    _inherit = 'product.template'


    processor = fields.Char(string='Computer Processor')


- In model folder make another init.py file to import the necessary from the product file
  from . import product

- Write the required code and inherit in product.py and then in the main init.py file import everything from models
  from . import models
- After that restart the environment and we will the module ready to be installed
